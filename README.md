- to convert a book into md files, with proper navigation between pages
- create a custom md preview, that remembers where you were in the book, allows you to highlight and capture notes

- and I will build the script to create the draft of a book summary, like the one I did for roam https://www.zsolt.blog/2020/12/my-book-summaries-in-roam-using-tiagos.html
